## 1. Feature Definition

Every new piece of work starts with a feature request. A feature should be a well-defined, atomic unit of work that delivers value to the end-user.

### 1.1. Feature Specification
- **Source**: Features can originate from product management, internal stakeholders, or engineering initiatives.
- **Ticket**: A ticket must be created in our project management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello) for every feature.
- **Requirements**: The ticket must contain:
    - A clear and concise **Title**.
    - A **Description** explaining the user story and the problem it solves (`As a [user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]`)
    - **Acceptance Criteria**: A checklist of conditions that must be met for the feature to be considered complete.
    - **Designs**: Links to UI/UX designs from Figma, if applicable.
    - **Technical Notes**: Any technical considerations, potential challenges, or proposed implementation details.

## 2. Development Workflow

Once a feature is clearly defined, it enters the development workflow.

### 2.1. Branching Strategy
We use a GitFlow-like branching model:
- `main`: Represents the production-ready code. Direct commits are forbidden.
- `develop`: The main development branch. All feature branches are merged into `develop`.
- `feature/<ticket-id>-<short-description>`: Each feature is developed in its own branch, created from `develop`. For example: `feature/PROJ-123-add-login-page`.

### 2.2. Implementation
1.  **Assignee**: A developer is assigned to the ticket.
2.  **Branch Creation**: The developer creates a new feature branch from the latest `develop`.
3.  **Development**: The developer implements the feature, writing code, unit tests, and integration tests.
    - **Commit Messages**: Commits should be atomic and have clear, descriptive messages (e.g., `feat(auth): add user registration endpoint`).
4.  **Code Review (Pull Request)**:
    - Once development is complete, the developer opens a Pull Request (PR) from their feature branch to `develop`.
    - The PR description should link to the ticket and summarize the changes.
    - At least two other developers must review the code, checking for correctness, style, and adherence to best practices.
5.  **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
    - Our CI pipeline automatically runs on every PR.
    - It performs static analysis, runs all tests, and builds the application.
    - The PR cannot be merged if the CI pipeline fails.
6.  **Merging**: Once the PR is approved and CI passes, it is merged into the `develop` branch. The feature branch is then deleted.

### 2.3. Release Cycle
1.  **Staging**: The `develop` branch is deployed to a staging environment for QA testing.
2.  **Release Branch**: When ready for a release, a `release/vX.Y.Z` branch is created from `develop`.
3.  **Production Deployment**: After final testing, the release branch is merged into `main` and tagged. The `main` branch is then deployed to production.
4.  **Hotfixes**: If a critical bug is found in production, a `hotfix/<ticket-id>` branch is created from `main`, fixed, and merged back into both `main` and `develop`.

## 3. Code Components

Our codebase is structured to be modular and maintainable. Understanding the components is key to effective development.

### 3.1. Frontend
- **Framework**: [e.g., React, Vue, Angular]
- **State Management**: [e.g., Redux, Vuex, NgRx]
- **Styling**: [e.g., CSS Modules, Styled-components, Tailwind CSS]
- **Component Library**: [e.g., Material-UI, Ant Design]
- **Directory Structure**:
    - `/src/components`: Reusable UI components.
    - `/src/pages` or `/src/views`: Application pages.
    - `/src/services` or `/src/api`: API communication logic.
    - `/src/store` or `/src/state`: State management logic.
    - `/src/utils`: Helper functions.

### 3.2. Backend
- **Framework**: [e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django, Go/Gin]
- **Database**: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB]
- **API Style**: [e.g., REST, GraphQL]
- **Authentication**: [e.g., JWT, OAuth2]
- **Directory Structure**:
    - `/src/controllers` or `/src/handlers`: Request handling logic.
    - `/src/services`: Business logic.
    - `/src/models`: Database schemas/models.
    - `/src/routes`: API endpoint definitions.
    - `/src/middleware`: Request middleware.

### 3.3. Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components in isolation. Located alongside the code (`*.test.js` or `*.spec.js`).
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between multiple components.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Simulate user flows from start to finish using tools like Cypress or Playwright.

## 4. Code Design Philosophy

This section details the principles we adhere to when designing and writing code, from high-level architecture down to individual functions and classes. Our goal is to create a codebase that is clean, maintainable, scalable, and easy for new developers to understand.

### 4.1. Core Principles

We follow established software design principles to guide our decisions:

-   **SOLID**: These five principles help us create understandable, flexible, and maintainable systems.
    -   **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class or function should have only one reason to change. It should do one thing and do it well.
    -   **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    -   **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
    -   **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Prefer smaller, specific interfaces over large, general-purpose ones.
    -   **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).

-   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid duplicating code. Abstract and reuse common logic to reduce redundancy, improve maintainability, and prevent bugs.

-   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Prefer simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones. Avoid unnecessary complexity and clever code that is hard to understand.

-   **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)**: Do not add functionality until it is deemed necessary. Avoid premature optimization and building features that aren't required yet.

### 4.2. Designing Functions

Well-designed functions are the building blocks of clean code.

-   **Small and Focused**: Functions should be short and do only one thing. If a function is doing multiple things, it should be broken down into smaller functions.
-   **Descriptive Naming**: The name of a function should clearly and concisely describe what it does. Use verb-noun pairs (e.g., `calculateTotalPrice`, `getUserById`).
-   **Few Arguments**: Aim for functions with three or fewer arguments. If a function requires many arguments, consider passing them as a single object.
-   **No Side Effects (when possible)**: A function should ideally be pure, meaning its return value is determined only by its input values, without observable side effects. This makes them easier to test and reason about.

### 4.3. Designing Classes and Components

-   **High Cohesion**: A class should have a single, well-defined purpose. Its methods and properties should be closely related and work together to achieve that purpose.
-   **Low Coupling**: Components should be as independent as possible. Minimize dependencies between classes to make the system more modular and easier to change.
-   **Composition Over Inheritance**: Favor composing objects from smaller, single-purpose objects over creating complex class hierarchies. Composition leads to more flexible and reusable designs.
-   **Clear APIs**: The public interface of a class or component should be clear, concise, and well-documented. Hide implementation details to reduce complexity for the consumer.

## 5. Test Strategy

A robust testing strategy is essential for ensuring software quality, reliability, and maintainability. Our approach is based on the "Testing Pyramid," which emphasizes a healthy balance of different types of tests.

### 5.1. The Testing Pyramid

We structure our tests in three primary layers:

-   **Unit Tests (Base of the Pyramid)**: These form the largest portion of our tests. They are fast, isolated, and cheap to write.
    -   **Purpose**: To verify that individual units of code (e.g., functions, components, classes) work correctly in isolation.
    -   **Scope**: A single function's logic, a React component's rendering, or a class's methods.
    -   **Tools**: [e.g., Jest, Vitest, PyTest]
    -   **Responsibility**: The developer writing the feature code is responsible for writing the corresponding unit tests.
    -   **When**: Written during development. A feature is not complete without sufficient unit test coverage.

-   **Integration Tests (Middle of the Pyramid)**: Fewer than unit tests, these are slightly slower and more complex.
    -   **Purpose**: To verify that different units of code work together as expected. They test the "glue" between components.
    -   **Scope**: Interaction between an API service and a database, communication between multiple microservices, or a sequence of UI components working together.
    -   **Tools**: [e.g., Supertest, Testing Library, Mock Service Worker]
    -   **Responsibility**: Primarily written by the feature developer, sometimes with support from QA.
    -   **When**: Written for key interaction points and critical workflows.

-   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Top of the Pyramid)**: The smallest and most expensive part of the pyramid. They are slow and can be brittle.
    -   **Purpose**: To simulate a real user's journey through the application from start to finish. They validate the entire system flow.
    -   **Scope**: A full user workflow, such as signing up, adding an item to a cart, and checking out.
    -   **Tools**: [e.g., Cypress, Playwright]
    -   **Responsibility**: Primarily written and maintained by the QA team, with collaboration from developers.
    -   **When**: Reserved for the most critical user paths and business flows.

### 5.2. Testing in the CI/CD Pipeline

-   **Pull Requests**: All unit and integration tests are automatically executed by our CI pipeline for every pull request. A PR cannot be merged if any tests fail.
-   **Staging Deployment**: After merging to `develop`, a full suite of tests, including E2E tests, is run against the staging environment.
-   **Production**: We monitor production for errors and have a hotfix process (as described in the workflow) to address critical issues quickly.

## 6. Observability & Monitoring

Deployment is not the end of the pipeline. A mature process includes understanding how the application behaves in production. Observability is key to detecting, investigating, and resolving issues proactively.

Our strategy is built on three pillars:

-   **Logging**: We collect structured logs from all services. Logs provide detailed, event-level insight into application behavior and are the first place to look when diagnosing a specific error.
    -   **Tools**: [e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk, Datadog]
-   **Metrics**: We track and visualize key system and application metrics in real-time dashboards. Metrics provide a high-level overview of system health.
    -   **Key Metrics**: Latency (response time), traffic (requests per second), error rate, and saturation (CPU/memory usage).
    -   **Tools**: [e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog]
-   **Alerting**: We configure automated alerts based on predefined metric thresholds. The on-call engineer is notified immediately when the system behaves abnormally, allowing for a rapid response.

## 7. Feature Flags (Feature Toggles)

Feature flags are a powerful technique to decouple code deployment from feature release. They allow us to deploy new code to production with the associated feature "turned off," mitigating risk and enabling advanced release patterns.

-   **How it Works**: A feature is wrapped in a conditional block that is controlled by a remote configuration service. We can toggle the feature on or off for all or a subset of users without a new deployment.
-   **Use Cases**:
    -   **Canary Releases**: Gradually roll out a new feature to a small percentage of users (e.g., 1%, 10%, 50%) to monitor its performance and impact before a full release.
    -   **A/B Testing**: Deploy multiple versions of a feature simultaneously and measure user engagement to make data-driven product decisions.
    -   **Kill Switch**: Instantly disable a faulty feature in production if it causes problems.
-   **Tools**: [e.g., LaunchDarkly, Optimizely]

## 8. Security Integration (DevSecOps)

We practice DevSecOps, which means integrating security practices into every phase of the development lifecycle ("shifting left"). This helps us identify and fix vulnerabilities early, when they are cheapest and easiest to resolve.

-   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Automated tools scan our source code for common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting) on every pull request.
    -   **Tools**: [e.g., Snyk, SonarQube]
-   **Dependency Scanning**: Our CI pipeline automatically scans all third-party libraries and dependencies for known vulnerabilities. A build will fail if a critical vulnerability is found in a dependency.
    -   **Tools**: [e.g., GitHub Dependabot, Snyk]
